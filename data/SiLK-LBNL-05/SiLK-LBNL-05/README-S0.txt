The included sample data is in SiLK format; SiLK-v0.10.0 or greater is
required to read it.

This sample data is derived from anonymized enterprise header
traces obtained from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and
ICSI, and is used here with their permission. This data covers
selected hours on selected dates in late 2004 and early 2005. For
more information on this dataset, see
http://www.icir.org/enterprise-tracing/Overview.html

The SiLK-LBNL-05-nonscan.tar.gz file includes only the NON-SCANNING
traffic from the LBNL/ICSI data.  The scanning traffic can be
downloaded from
http://tools.netsa.cert.org/silk/silk_referencedata.html

The non-scanning and scanning traffic can be expanded on top of each
other.  The traffic sets use different sensor names which will not
collide.

The data assumes you have configured SiLK with sensor named S0.  For
instructions on configuring SiLK, see the SiLK Installation Handbook,
http://tools.netsa.cert.org/silk/silk_docs.html

This directory, SiLK-LBNL-05, can be used as the top-level data
directory for rwfilter by setting the environment variable
SILK_DATA_ROOTDIR to its location.  The non-scanning traffic appears
as sensor S0, and the scanning traffic as sensor S1.  This allows the
two sets of data to be analyzed together (though note that the two
sets of data are anonymized differently) or separately (via the
"--sensor" switch on rwfilter).

The inside of the network is assumed to contain the following CIDR
blocks:

  128.3.0.0/16
  128.55.0.0/16
  131.243.0.0/16
  198.125.133.0/24
  198.128.24.0/22
  198.129.88.0/22
